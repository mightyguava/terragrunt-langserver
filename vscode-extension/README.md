# Terragrunt VS Code Extension

This is a fork of https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide.

Most of the functionality comes from the language server in Go. This extension starts up the server and acts a client.

## Functionality

See [Project README](../README.md)

## Structure

```

├── client // Language Client
│   ├── src
